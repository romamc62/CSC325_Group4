# CSC325 Group 4 Project:
## Blood Pressure Monitoring & Alert System.

## WRSPM: 
Our capstone project focuses on building a Blood Pressure Monitoring & Health Tracker App, aimed at helping individuals monitor and manage their blood pressure levels daily. The app will be particularly beneficial for users with hypertension, elderly individuals, and those under long-term health supervision. It will provide an intuitive and mobile-friendly platform for users to record their systolic and diastolic readings, track changes over time, receive health alerts, and share reports with healthcare providers.

The app will feature an easy-to-use interface where users can log in, input blood pressure data manually or via Bluetooth-enabled monitors, and visualize their readings through graphs and trend lines. Daily reminders and push notifications will prompt users to take readings consistently. The system will also provide recommendations based on the input valuesâ€”for example, notifying users if their readings fall outside of a healthy range and encouraging them to consult a physician.

The project will be built using JavaFX and MySQL and will be developed in NetBeans. We will use GitHub for version control and collaboration, and YouTrack to assign and track tasks. A basic design for the interface will be created using Figma, and the full system will follow the WRSPM model for planning and documentation. The fake email system will not send real emails but will generate logs to show what would have been sent in a real application.
